# 🧨 RedTeamFromScratch

Welcome to my red team ramp-up — part study guide, part simulation, part personal lab notebook.

I'm a Navy veteran pivoting into offensive security with zero formal tech background, just grit, caffeine, and curiosity. This repo tracks my hands-on learning across core red teaming concepts using free tools, public labs, and real-world exploit writeups.

## 🔍 What's in this repo?

Each day focuses on a specific vulnerability, tool, or adversarial technique. For each one, I break down:

- 📓 **Technical notes** and concepts
- 🧪 **Labs and walk-throughs**
- 💣 **Payloads** and testing strategies
- 🛡️ **Mitigations** and defense notes
- 📚 **Real-world examples** and CVEs
- 🔁 **Reflections** on what tripped me up or clicked

### ✅ Sample Topics:

- SSRF
- XSS
- LFI/RFI
- SQLi
- IDOR
- Authentication bypasses
- Enumeration tooling (FFUF, Nmap, Gobuster, etc.)

## ⚙️ My Setup

- Kali Linux (VM)
- Burp Suite Community
- Obsidian for daily logs + longform notes
- GitHub for version control + portfolio building

## 💡 Why I’m Doing This

I got tired of waiting for the “right” way to break into cyber. So I started building my own.

This is part bootcamp, part accountability, part message in a bottle to other late bloomers, career switchers, and curious weirdos learning in public.
