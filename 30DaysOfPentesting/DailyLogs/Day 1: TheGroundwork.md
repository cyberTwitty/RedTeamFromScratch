Block 1: Lab setup and tool familiarization
Goals

1. Begin setup of offensive security lab
2. Install and confirm pentesting tools in Kali Linux

- I setup a virtual machine through Oracle.

Commands used:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt install nmap gobuster ffuf python3-pip git burpsuite -y

- "sudo apt update"
  - contacts all package repositories listed on my system and retrieves the latest lists of available software/versions
- "sudo apt upgrade -y"
  - installs the latest versions of all packages currently listed on my system based on the previous results from "sudo apt update"
  - "-y" just answers yes to any prompts so there's no need for my input
- "sudo apt install [packages]-y"

  - installs all of the desired tools in one go without having to call each one individually
  - nmap: used for network scanning and port enumeration
  - gobuster: used for directory and file brute-forcing on web servers (like to find a hidden path)
  - ffuf: web fuzzer for directories, subdomains, and parameters. Often quicker than gobuster and better at fuzzing POST data and parameters
  - python3-pip: installs Pip, the package manager for Python3 so I can install libraries like "requests" and "pwntools"
  - git: version control
  - burpsuite: intercepts and manipulates HTTP/S traffic to test web applications

- Confirm downloaded tools:
  - nmap: used "nmap scanme.nmap.org" to run a basic scan
  - gobuster: confirmed installation with "gobuster -h"
  - burpsuite: launched from the terminal
  - VSCode: launched from terminal using "code ."

sudo ip addr del (my IP address) dev eth0

- removes my "real" address without touching the static one I set up using nano text editor
- this setting will _not_ persist after reboot, so if I want to keep an isolated lab running, I'll have to use a different method.

sudo ip addr del (my IP address) dev eth0

NMAP practice:

- run

Errors Confronted:
Burpsuite:

- "Your JRE appears to be version 21.0.7-ea from Debian Burp has not been fully tested on this platform and you may experience problems"
  - Burpsuite runs on Java. My Java version is an "early access" version that's newer than what Burp has been officially tested against. No biggie. We read the warnings and we don't judge. (Meaning I just clicked ok because this is an isolated machine anyway)
  - If I choose to fix the issue, I'll use the following command to downgrade to a version of Java that Burpsuite plays well with:
    "sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre", "sudo update-alternatives --config java", pick option with Java 17 and relaunch burpsuite
