# 🛠️ Day 3 – Recon Begins: Gobuster

## 🎯 Overall Goal:

Kick off active reconnaissance by identifying visible and hidden web application components on the Metasploitable2 target. Begin mapping the target’s surface area using directory brute-forcing with Gobuster. Build familiarity with how discovery tooling uncovers attack paths in real-world environments.

## 🧱 Gobuster Recon

### 🎯 Block Goal:

Use Gobuster to brute-force discover hidden directories and files on Metasploitable2's web server. Identify entry points for deeper enumeration and potential exploits.

### 💻 Commands Used:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.77.20 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -x php,html,txt,bak

```

Tells Gobuster to:

    🔍 Scan http://192.168.77.20
    🧠 Use a big wordlist of common directories & file names
    🔎 Try file extensions like .php, .html, .txt, .bak
    🚫 Ignore 404s (not found)
    💥 Show any other response codes (like 200, 301, 403)

### 🔧 Setup Notes:

### 🔁 Network Reconfiguration Recap (a.k.a. The GIMP Spiral of Doom)

What started as an innocent desire to redact a Gobuster screenshot “properly” spiraled into a full-blown detour through network chaos. To install GIMP for clean redactions, I had to temporarily enable Kali’s internet (NAT mode), which broke my isolated lab connection (as expected... but still 😤).

I:

- Enabled NAT to download GIMP 🧙‍♀️
- Lost internal static IP 💀
- Tried pinging things that didn't exist
- Questioned everything
- Fixed the `/etc/network/interfaces` file like an absolute legend 💪
- Switched Kali back to Host-Only Adapter
- Reassigned static IP (`192.168.77.10`)
- Restarted networking services and double-checked with `ip a`
- 🎯 Verified lab isolation was restored by successfully pinging Metasploitable (`192.168.77.20`)

💡 Lesson learned: screenshots can wait. Stay on mission. But also... I _did_ get GIMP working, so that’s a win too 😎

### 📥 Output Highlights:

    /phpmyadmin/ — Possible DB admin panel

    /dvwa/ — Damn Vulnerable Web App (intended for exploitation)

    /mutillidae/ — OWASP practice app (loaded with testable vulnerabilities)

    /test/ — Unknown dev folder, may contain weak or outdated code

### 🧠 Observations:

Gobuster is fast and precise but output can be overwhelming without filters

Most targets don't advertise themselves—seems obvious, but it feels different when you're trying to gitem. Why can't you just let me find you!!?
