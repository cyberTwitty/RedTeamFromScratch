# 🛠️ Day 4 – Burp Repeater and TryHackMe

## 🎯 Overall Goal:

Kick off active reconnaissance by identifying visible and hidden web application components on the Metasploitable2 target. Begin mapping the target’s surface area using directory brute-forcing with Gobuster. Build familiarity with how discovery tooling uncovers attack paths in real-world environments.

#### (Screenshots for the day can be seen [here](../Screenshots/Day4.md). Judge away, oh mighty Judgers! )

## Block 1: Git Repo Hygiene

### 🎯 Block Goal:

Get my repo structure and past logs tight(er?). Make sure everything is accessible, redacted, and clean.

### ✅ Subtasks:

- [x] Fix README.md daily links (update paths to DailyLogs/DayX.md)

- [x] Redact and store yesterday’s screenshots in Screenshots/Day3/

- [x] Create Screenshots/Day4/ now to keep today clean

- [x] Sanity check all filenames (avoid spaces, use lowercase and hyphens)

- [x] Push with commits like:
      `fix: update day 3 log links in README`
      `chore: add redacted gobuster output to Screenshots/Day3`

## 🧩 Block 2: DVWA Testing – SQL Injection (Low Security)

### 🎯 Block Goal

Perform a full test of DVWA’s classic SQLi module on low security and capture the full attack chain.

I am trying to:

- Confirm SQLi injection is possible in the given form field
- Extract user list from DB (even if it's just test data)
- Write an informative and concise log entry

---

### Subtasks:

- [x] Set DVWA security to `low`
- [x] Navigate to "SQL Injection"
- [x] Try `user ID` of `1` and observe results
- [x] Try a basic payload: ` ' OR 1=1--`, ` ' OR 1=1 #`, ` ' OR 1=1--+`
- [x] Capture request in Burp -> send to repeater
- [x] Screenshots! (Screenshots for the day can be seen [here](../Screenshots/Day4.md))
  - [x] Original Request
  - [x] Modified Payload
  - [x] Resulting page dump

### 🛠️ Commands Used

```bash
  `ping [target IP] & ping [my IP]` # to make sure everyone is up and ping'able.
  `burpsuite` # opens the app in a new window.
```

### ⚙️ Setup Notes

Burp is listening, DVWA is logged in and security is set to 'low'

#### 🧠 Quick Recap of SQL Comment Options (MySQL):

| Operator | Works Without Space? | Notes                                |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `--`     | ❌ No                | Requires **space** after it (`--` )  |
| `--+`    | ⚠️ Maybe             | Depends on how the server parses `+` |
| `#`      | ✅ Yes               | Most reliable, doesn’t need a space  |
