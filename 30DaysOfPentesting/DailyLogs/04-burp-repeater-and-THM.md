# 🛠️ Day 4 – Burp Repeater and TryHackMe

## 🎯 Overall Goal:

Kick off active reconnaissance by identifying visible and hidden web application components on the Metasploitable2 target. Begin mapping the target’s surface area using directory brute-forcing with Gobuster. Build familiarity with how discovery tooling uncovers attack paths in real-world environments.

## Block 1: Git Repo Hygiene

### 🎯 Block Goal:

Get my repo structure and past logs tight(er?). Make sure everything is accessible, redacted, and clean.

### ✅ Subtasks:

- [x] Fix README.md daily links (update paths to DailyLogs/DayX.md)

- [x] Redact and store yesterday’s screenshots in Screenshots/Day3/

- [x] Create Screenshots/Day4/ now to keep today clean

- [x] Sanity check all filenames (avoid spaces, use lowercase and hyphens)

- [x] Push with commits like:
      `fix: update day 3 log links in README`
      `chore: add redacted gobuster output to Screenshots/Day3`

## 🧩 Block 2: DVWA Testing – SQL Injection (Low Security)

### 🎯 Goal 1 - Test the User ID input field:

Perform a full test of DVWA’s classic SQLi module on low security and capture the full attack chain.

I am trying to:

- Confirm SQLi injection is possible in the given form field
- Extract user list from DB (even if it's just test data)
- Write an informative and concise log entry

### Subtasks:

- [x] Set DVWA security to `low`
- [x] Navigate to "SQL Injection"
- [x] Try `user ID` of `1` and observe results
- [x] Try a basic payload: ` ' OR 1=1--`, ` ' OR 1=1 #`, ` ' OR 1=1--+`
- [x] Capture request in Burp -> send to repeater
- [x] Screenshots! (Screenshots for the day can be seen [here](../Screenshots/Day4.md))
  - [x] Original Request
  - [x] Modified Payload
  - [x] Resulting page dump

---

### 🎯 Goal 2 - Dump some (or all 😈) users from the DB:

Leverage SQL injection to enumerate database contents and extract a list of users from the DVWA application, simulating a real-world post-exploitation data leak.

### Subtasks:

- [x] Try `' UNION SELECT null, version(), user() #` to see if UNION is allowed and will help us gain version info
- [ ] Enumerate table names with `' UNION SELECT null, table_name FROM information_schema.tables #`
- [ ] Enumerate columns from the `users` table with `' UNION SELECT null, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='users'`
- [ ] Dump user credentials with `' UNION SELECT user, password FROM users #`
- [ ] Screenshots! (Screenshots for the day can be seen [here](../Screenshots/Day4.md))
  - [x] Confirm UNION injection
  - [ ] Table names
  - [ ] Column names
  - [ ] Dumped usernames & hashes

### 🛠️ Commands Used

```sql
-- As entered in the vulnerable input field or in Burp Repeater:
' UNION SELECT null, version(), user() #
' UNION SELECT null, table_name FROM information_schema.tables #
' UNION SELECT null, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='users' #
' UNION SELECT user, password FROM users #

```

### ⚙️ Setup Notes

Burp is listening. I'll use the Repeater for better control and reusability of payloads (or so ChatGPT tells me, I have no idea what I'm doing yet).  
DVWA is logged in and security is set to 'low'  
I **have** to remember to turn off intercept after the initial capture is sent to Repeater

### 🔍 Observations

💬 Favorite Takeaway of the Day:

> "A syntax error is not a failure, it's an invitation."
> — Some Red Teamer, somewhere

While working on SQL injection in DVWA, I hit an error saying:

`The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns.`

At first, it felt like I broke something. But I am learning that moments like this are actually great signs. It means the app is vulnerable and talking back, and all ("all" 😂😅) I need to do is fine-tune my syntax. These error messages are clues — not dead ends.

Instead of frustration, I felt like I was starting to speak the same language as the database, even if it's a different dialect. We're getting somewhere!

#### 🧠 Quick Recap of SQL Comment Options (MySQL):

| Operator | Works Without Space? | Notes                                |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `--`     | ❌ No                | Requires **space** after it (`--` )  |
| `--+`    | ⚠️ Maybe             | Depends on how the server parses `+` |
| `#`      | ✅ Yes               | Most reliable, doesn’t need a space  |
