# 🛠️ Day 4 – Burp Repeater and TryHackMe

## 🎯 Overall Goal:

Kick off active reconnaissance by identifying visible and hidden web application components on the Metasploitable2 target. Begin mapping the target’s surface area using directory brute-forcing with Gobuster. Build familiarity with how discovery tooling uncovers attack paths in real-world environments.

## Block 1: Git Repo Hygiene

### 🎯 Block Goal:

Get my repo structure and past logs tight(er?). Make sure everything is accessible, redacted, and clean.

### ✅ Subtasks:

- [x] Fix README.md daily links (update paths to DailyLogs/DayX.md)

- [x] Redact and store yesterday’s screenshots in Screenshots/Day3/

- [x] Create Screenshots/Day4/ now to keep today clean

- [x] Sanity check all filenames (avoid spaces, use lowercase and hyphens)

- [x] Push with commits like:
      `fix: update day 3 log links in README`
      `chore: add redacted gobuster output to Screenshots/Day3`

### 🔧 Setup Notes:

## 🧩 Block 2: DVWA Testing – SQL Injection (Low Security)

### 🎯 Block Goal

Perform a full test of DVWA’s classic SQLi module on low security and capture the full attack chain.

I am trying to:

- Confirm SQLi
- Extract user list from DB (even if it's just test data)
- Write an informative and concise log entry
