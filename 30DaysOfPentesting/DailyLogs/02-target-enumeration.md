# 🗓️ Day 2: Target Enumeration

## 🎯 Overall Goal:

Perform web application reconnaissance on a lab target using `gobuster` and `burpsuite` to identify directories, parameters, and potential input points.

---

## 🧱 Block 1: Gobuster Recon

### 🎯 Block Goal:

- Discover hidden directories or files on the web server.
- Understand the structure of the web app target.

### 💻 Commands Used:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.77.20 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.77.20 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -x php,html,txt
```

### 🔧 Setup Notes:

### 🧩 Output Highlights:

### ⚠️ Errors/Notes:

- ❗️Couldn’t disable I/O APIC at first—VirtualBox auto-enabled it due to multiple CPUs being set
  - 🛠 Resolved by setting processor count to **1**, which allowed I/O APIC to be disabled without error
  - ✅ VM now boots cleanly into login screen without kernel panic

## 🧱 Block 2: Burp Suite Interception

### 🎯 Block Goal:

- Use Burp Suite’s Intercept tab to:

- Capture a live HTTP(S) request from your browser

- Analyze the request method, headers, and body

- Send it to Repeater for further tampering

### 💻 Commands Used:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.77.20 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.77.20 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -x php,html,txt
```

### 🔧 Setup Notes:

### 🧩 Output Highlights:

### ⚠️ Errors/Notes:

- ❗️Importing Burp’s CA cert into Brave failed at first.
  - 🛠 Brave thought I was importing a _client certificate_ because I used the **"Your Certificates"** tab instead of **"Authorities"**.
  - ✅ Once I imported the `burp.crt` under **Authorities** and checked “Trust this CA…”, it worked.
- ❗️Brave stays in proxy mode when launched with `--proxy-server`.
  - ✅ Needed to fully close or `pkill` the process to return to normal browsing.
- ❗️When forwarding an intercepted request to an unreachable host, Burp Suite returned its own branded error page in the browser.
  - 🛠 This happens when Burp can't connect to the destination—it becomes the responder and exposes itself.
  - ✅ In a real-world scenario, this would leak that Burp is in use. In a lab, it's harmless. Now I know to verify connectivity before forwarding requests.

## 🧱 Block 3: Reflection & Report

### 🎯 Block Goal:

- Summarize findings
- Push updates to GitHub
- Prep notes for tomorrow's exploitation
