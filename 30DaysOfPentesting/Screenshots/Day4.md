## 🖼 Kernel Panic on Metasploitable Boot

![alt text](link)

**What I Was Doing:**  
Trying to boot up Metasploitable2 for the first time in VirtualBox.

**What Went Wrong:**  
Got hit with a scary “Kernel Panic – not syncing” error. Thought I broke something major.

**What I Learned:**  
It was a mismatch between the number of processors and the IO-APIC setting. Fixed it by disabling IO-APIC and dropping to one processor. Crisis averted.

**What I Was Doing:**  
Testing DNS resolution with `ping google.com`.

**What Went Wrong:**  
Got “Temporary failure in name resolution” – turns out Kali had no working DNS because I had disabled internet earlier. Oops.

**What I Learned:**  
Connectivity matters. Especially when trying to install tools or troubleshoot network issues.
