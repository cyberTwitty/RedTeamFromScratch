## üõ†Ô∏è Proxy Setup (Manual Method)

- Launch Burp Suite from terminal ( `burpsuite` )
- After selecting a "Temporary Project in Memory" and selecting "burp defaults", click "start"
- Once on the homepage, go to the "Proxy" tab
- Click "settings" to make sure your listeners are set up correctly. Once confirmed, close this window
- Back on the "Proxy" tab, toggle the "Intercept" button to "on"
- In a new terminal tab, open your browser of choice with proxy (` brave-browser --proxy-server:"127.0.0.1:8080" `) 
- REMEMBER: You *might* have to configure your browser to accept Burp's certificate (refer to http://burp )
