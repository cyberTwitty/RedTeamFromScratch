## ⌨️ Proxy Setup in Burp

- Navigate to Proxy -> Options
- Ensure the listener is set to `127.0.0.1:8080`
- Trust the Burp Certificate found at `http://burp`
  - Export the CA Cert from Burp
  - Import into Brave -> Settings -> Security -> Manage Certificates

## ⚽ Future Goals

- FoxyProxy setup?
- Other things I want to get to persist across sessions?
- Profit.
