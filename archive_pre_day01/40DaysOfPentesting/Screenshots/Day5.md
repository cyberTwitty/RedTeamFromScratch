# Screenshots for Day 5: Break More Things
## Screenshot 1

![DVWA SQLi Source Code Screenshot](raw-images/dvwa-sql-sourcecode.png "Viewing the source code showed me exactly how DVWA processes the user ID input, while planting the seed of doubt that led to uncovering deeper issues in my test environment.")


**ðŸ”¹ What I Was Doing ðŸ”¹**

> While exploring DVWA's SQL injection module, I noticed a "View Source" button on the lower right-hand side of the page. I clicked it out of curiosity -- just poking around -- and landed on a PHP file showing the backend logic for how the application handles SQL queries. I wanted to understand how DVWA is processing the input I'm feeding it. 

**ðŸ”¸ What Went Wrong ðŸ”¸**

> Technically, nothing! This was a key moment though because seeing this source code raised some questions -- namely, if the app is escaping input with `mysql_real_escape_string()` and checking for numeric values, why was I still able to exploit SQL injection (SQLi) earlier? That question led to the realization that DVWA's security level was changing every time I switched from the home page to anywhere else. 

**ðŸ’¡ What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- DVWA letting me see the PHP source code helped me better understand how input are filtered and what logic sets up the checkpoint for injection.
- The application is using `is_numeric()` to limit input types and `my_sql_real_escape_string()` to sanitize them -- basic defenses when DVWA's security level is set to 'low', but defenses that get stronger as the level increases.  
- Reading source code isn't cheating! It's intel! Real-world apps won't give me this luxury on a silver, in-your-face-button platter all the time, but when they do, it can give me a big advantage.

## Screenshot 2

![Intruder test for ORDER BY column count](raw-images/burp-suite-intruder-tab.png "Investigating column structure with Intruder â€” and spotting cookie chaos")

**ðŸ”¹ What I Was Doing ðŸ”¹**

> I wanted to test the Burp Suite Intruder Tab for the first time, using it to automate the discovery of how many columns the `users` table in DVWA actually returns. I was hoping it would help prep for a working `UNION SELECT` payload. I knew from earlier, manual attempts, that setting up each number by hand would get tedious fast, so Intruder felt like the right tool for the loop. 

**ðŸ”¸ What Went Wrong ðŸ”¸**

> Even though I was running a successful attack cycle -- no errors in the requests themselves -- I noticed the lengths of responses stayed nearly identical across payloads. That's when I spotted something strange in the request cookie: `security=low` and `security=high` were both included. This confirmed a sneaky suspicion that *something* wasn't right with the DVWA security level's persistence. It was quietly switching back to `high` between pages/requests. Even though I'd asked it nicely, many, MANY times to stay on `low`. 

**ðŸ’¡ What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- Intruder is a fun tool! Even though the results didn't tell me exactly what I wanted, they told me something wasn't right. 
- Cookie inspection in Burp can catch config drift, like a security level quietly flipping.
- Always validate your test environment's integrity before assuming you're the problem. I mean, I guess *technically* since I'm the one who set up the lab, I *am* the problem, but it's been a long one, so today we're blaming the environment.

## Screenshots 3-7

![Burp Suiteâ€™s Proxy history tab displaying multiple HTTP requests to the DVWA site.](raw-images/proxy-history-security-low.png "Security=low was showing, but in other attempts, both security=low and security=high would be in the list, suggesting that the DVWA instance is misconfigured or reverting to previous settings.")

![DVWA's settings are commonly stored in this location, so I checked here next.](raw-images/searching-for-config.png "Terminal commands `locate` and `find` were used to search for the config.inc.php file. No results were returned, hinting that DVWA wasn't installed in the default Apache location.")

![Tried using Nano to find the DVWA Directory](raw-images/nano-says-dir-does-not-exist.png "Getting a 'does not exist' message confirmed that even manual navigation to where DVWA should be was a fail. The mystery of where I installed this thing deepens.")

![A netstat search showed that port 8080 is being used locally.](raw-images/netstat-results.png "This results indicates that there is indeed a service bound to the address and port I originally set up. The problem is it isn't DVWA. There might be another server active in the background.")

![Terminal output of an nmap scan of ports 1-1000 on my target IP address.](raw-images/nmap-scan-for-DVWA.png "The results show numerous open ports including HTTP(80) and MySQL(3306), and unknown services on ports like 8180. Does this mean DVWA is technically accessible, but I just don't get to see which service is actually hosting it?")

**ðŸ”¹ What I Was Doing ðŸ”¹**

> After noticing that the DVWA security setting kept reverting to `high` no matter how often I reset it to `low`, I tried to trace the true location of the DVWA web server. My goal was to identify where DVWA was actually hosted, validate its configuration, and figure out why its behavior wasn't aligning with my expectations.
> I started with Burp Suite's proxy tab, clicking on different buttons on DVWA and getting proof that the security level was changing. Then I looked for the file manually and couldn't find it. I then looked for the directory using Nano (because who doesn't need more practice with that?). Nothin. Finally I did a netstat search as well as an nmap scan (again, practice = good), but none of those told me where I might find what I was looking for. 

**ðŸ”¸ What Went Wrong ðŸ”¸**

> I fell face-first into an environment rabbit hole. My nmap scan confirmed Metasploitable2 was alive and listening on port 80, but nothing there showed DVWA. My netstat output showed something running on 127.0.0.1:8080 (*cough* Burp Suite *cough*), but not much else. Directory lookups failed. In Burp, the cookie values gave me mixed signals. The `Host` and cookie paths seemed inconsistent, leading me to question whether or not I was barking up the wrong VM entirely. 
> Did I break something? Or just imagine this WHOLE lab into existence? 

**ðŸ’¡ What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- Sometimes environments fib. Not out of malice, at least I don't *think* it's out of malice. Sometimes there are legacy setups, misconfigurations, or just weird VirtualBox behaviors.
- Validating my own assumptions was a good move, even though it was/is painful. I *assumed* my Burp traffic was fully aligned with DVWA's backend. I *assumed* DVWA was running on the Metasploitable2 machine I set up. All of that needed to be verified. 
- If I could get the last 2+ workdays back, I think I'd try running `ps aux | grep apache` or another similar process to check inside each of my VMs for hosted web services and paths. Flashy fuzzing attemps could have waited.
