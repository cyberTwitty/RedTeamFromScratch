## 💬 From the Field

This whole saga is hitting harder than I expected.

As someone who’s been navigating the cybersecurity space for just over a year, I’ve come to rely on CVE as one of the few constants in a sea of noise. It always felt like the closest thing we have to a shared, standardized truth — one place to learn from, one place to trust when shining a light on the monsters under the bed.

If this shift marks the beginning of privatized influence over vulnerability visibility, that’s not just a transparency concern — it’s another gate. Another layer of friction for folks like me trying to learn the rules, understand the risks, and contribute meaningfully. And it’s not just about access — it strikes at the heart of what and *who* we’re supposed to protect.

We all learn about the CIA triad — Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability — as the foundation of cybersecurity. But if CVE, one of our most public pillars of integrity and availability, becomes harder to access or skewed by hidden influence… haven’t we already lost two-thirds of that equation?

Maybe this new CVE Foundation really will be the fix. Maybe it’ll bring structure and sustainability without selling off the soul. I hope so.

But from where I sit, it feels like the gears of consolidation are grinding toward something less accessible — and that’s the last thing this field needs.
