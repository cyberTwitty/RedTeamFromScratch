## ðŸ§± Block 1: Environment Triage

### ðŸŽ¯ Block 1 Goal

Give directory brute-forcing a shot. I want to start getting comfortable using FFUF and Gobuster to uncover hidden files and endpoints; a crucial skill for mapping attack surfaces in real-world engagements.

#### Subtasks for Block 1

- [x] Learn what a wordlist actually is and how it powers web fuzzers
- [x] Inspect some common ones like `common.txt` and `directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`, etc
- [x] Use FFUF to fuxx my DVWA instance:
  
  ```bash
    ffuf -u http://-MyTargetIP-/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
  ```

- [x] Repeat with Gobuster

  ```bash
    gobuster dir -u http://-MyTargetIP-/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
  ```

- [x] Compare the results side-by-side and note any `/uploads`, `admin`, `config`, or other spicy directories
