# ðŸŽ® Day #7 â€“ Discovery & Web Recon Basics

**(Screenshots for the day can be seen [here](../Screenshots/Day6.md). Judge away, oh mighty Judgers! )**

## ðŸ§± Block 1: FFUF and Gobuster Practice

### ðŸŽ¯ Block 1 Goal

Give directory brute-forcing a shot. I want to start getting comfortable using FFUF and Gobuster to uncover hidden files and endpoints; a crucial skill for mapping attack surfaces in real-world engagements.

#### Tasks for Block 1

- [x] Learn what a wordlist actually is and how it powers web fuzzers
- [x] Inspect some common ones like `common.txt` and `directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`, etc
- [x] Use FFUF to fuxx my DVWA instance:
  
  ```bash
    ffuf -u http://-MyTargetIP-/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
  ```

- [x] Repeat with Gobuster

  ```bash
    gobuster dir -u http://-MyTargetIP-/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
  ```

- [x] Compare the results side-by-side and note any `/uploads`, `admin`, `config`, or other spicy directories

### ðŸ§  Observations for Block 1

Even though I used `ffuf` and `gobuster` to scan the IP I normally use to access DVWA, these tools are not interacting with DVWA specifically -- they're scanning the entire web server hosted on Metasploitable2 (Apache, port 80). DVWA is just one of many vulnerable web apps hosted there. Tools like `ffuf` don't need a browser or Burp Suite to be running. They directly send raw HTTP requests to the server, looking for valid paths or files, regardless of which app is running at each one.

## ðŸ§± Block 2: Digging Deeper

### ðŸŽ¯ Block 2 Goal

Move from passive recon to targeted discovery by analyzing high-value directories and pages found in FFUF/Gobuster results to uncover web application weaknesses or dangerous misconfigurations.

#### Tasks for Block 2

- Manual directory exploration
  - [x] Visit each directory discovered (e.g. `/phpMyAdmin`, `/test`, `/twiki`)
  - [x] Interact with forms and login fields to see if they accept default credentials, give error messages, or expose anything "weird"
  - [x] View source and inspect page elements
- Analyze senstitive pages
  - [ ] Open `/phpinfo.php` and examine the PHP version, config paths, and enabled extensions
  - [ ] Compare PHP version to known CVEs (Exploit-DB or CVE Details)
- Research & Context
  - [ ] Look up default credentials for phpMyAdmin for the version
  - [ ] Learn what the `mcrypt` warning means
- Document & Reflect
  - [ ] Record attempted credentials and their outcomes
  - [ ] Screenshot login errors, version disclosures, or suspicious behavior
  
### ðŸ§  Observations for Block 2

1. Testing `/test/` and `/test/testoutput/` endpoints
   1. These folders are browsable, meaning directory listing is enabled
   2. The filename suggests this is part of a test or logging system, potentially connected to the OWASP ESAPI project?
   3. When inspecting the request in the Network tab, I confirmed that the server is responding with a `304 Not Modified` status. This means the file exists, but hasn't changed since it was last cached by the browser. It's not an error, it means the page isn't broken, but it doesn't contain any frontend code or other displayable content.
2.
