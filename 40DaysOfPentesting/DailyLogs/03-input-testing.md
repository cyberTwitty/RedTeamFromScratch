# 🛠️ Day 3 – Recon Begins: Gobuster

## 🎯 Overall Goal:

Kick off active reconnaissance by identifying visible and hidden web application components on the Metasploitable2 target. Begin mapping the target’s surface area using directory brute-forcing with Gobuster. Build familiarity with how discovery tooling uncovers attack paths in real-world environments.

#### (Screenshots for the day can be seen [here](../Screenshots/Day3.md). Judge away, oh mighty Judgers! )

## 🧱 Gobuster Recon

### 🎯 Block Goal:

Use Gobuster to brute-force discover hidden directories and files on Metasploitable2's web server. Identify entry points for deeper enumeration and potential exploits.

### 💻 Commands Used:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.77.20 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -x php,html,txt,bak

```

Tells Gobuster to:

    🔍 Scan http://192.168.77.20
    🧠 Use a big wordlist of common directories & file names
    🔎 Try file extensions like .php, .html, .txt, .bak
    🚫 Ignore 404s (not found)
    💥 Show any other response codes (like 200, 301, 403)

### 🔧 Setup Notes:

### 🔁 Network Reconfiguration Recap (a.k.a. The GIMP Spiral of Doom)

What started as an innocent desire to redact a Gobuster screenshot “properly” spiraled into a full-blown detour through network chaos. To install GIMP for clean redactions, I had to temporarily enable Kali’s internet (NAT mode), which broke my isolated lab connection (as expected... but still 😤).

I:

- Enabled NAT to download GIMP 🧙‍♀️
- Lost internal static IP 💀
- Tried pinging things that didn't exist
- Questioned everything
- Fixed the `/etc/network/interfaces` file like an absolute legend 💪
- Switched Kali back to Host-Only Adapter
- Reassigned static IP (`192.168.77.10`)
- Restarted networking services and double-checked with `ip a`
- 🎯 Verified lab isolation was restored by successfully pinging Metasploitable (`192.168.77.20`)

💡 Lesson learned: screenshots can wait. Stay on mission. But also... I _did_ get GIMP working, so that’s a win too 😎

### 📥 Output Highlights:

    /phpmyadmin/ — Possible DB admin panel

    /dvwa/ — Damn Vulnerable Web App (intended for exploitation)

    /mutillidae/ — OWASP practice app (loaded with testable vulnerabilities)

    /test/ — Unknown dev folder, may contain weak or outdated code

### 🧠 Observations:

Gobuster is fast and precise but output can be overwhelming without filters

Most targets don't advertise themselves—seems obvious, but it feels different when you're trying to gitem. Why can't you just let me find you!!?

## 🧩 Block 2: Burp Intercept & DVWA Login Flow

### 🎯 Block Goal

Capture and analyze an intercepted login request using Burp Suite, successfully authenticate with DVWA, and prepare for authenticated testing.

---

### 🛠️ Commands Used

```bash
# Launch Burp Suite
burpsuite

# Launch Brave routed through Burp proxy
brave-browser --proxy-server="127.0.0.1:8080"

```

### ⚙️ Setup Notes

⚠️ Metasploitable2 stalled at startup with repetitive service checks. No login screen appeared until hard restart. Possibly caused by failed NFS utilities or lingering kernel config issues.

Opened Burp Suite as a temporary project with default config

Started Burp Proxy on default `127.0.0.1:8080`

Launched Brave with proxy override pointing to Burp

Navigated to `http://192.168.77.20/dvwa/`

Enabled Burp intercept to capture initial GET request

Realized full page wasn't loading due to intercept holding assets hostage 😅

Disabled intercept to allow full DVWA page to render

Attempted login with incorrect credentials `(admin / admin123)` → login failed

Discovered correct default login is:
Username: `admin`
Password: `password`

### 📤 Output Highlights

Captured POST request to `/dvwa/login.php` in Burp Repeater

Saw form payload in body:
`username=admin&password=password&Login=Login`

Response returned: `HTTP/1.1 302 Found` (redirect = success!)

Brave UI displayed:

"You have logged in as 'admin'"

DVWA Security level cookie confirmed in Burp headers:
`Cookie: security=high`

### 🔍 Observations

- Intercepting too early holds up the whole browser experience—remember to toggle it off!

- Burp Repeater is perfect for replaying POST requests without needing to keep logging in manually

- 302 redirect is often a positive auth signal when testing login flows

- Security level was set to high, which can block or obscure many vulnerable behaviors

- Using `admin:password` worked like a charm and created a valid `PHPSESSID`

- This sets the stage for testing vulnerable features with full session context

### ✅ Next Steps

Lower DVWA security level to low via the DVWA Security tab

Begin testing:

SQL Injection (start with classic)

Command Execution

File Upload

Time to break some stuff. 😈💣
