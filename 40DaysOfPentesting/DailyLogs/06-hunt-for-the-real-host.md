# 🛠️ Day #6 – The Hunt for the Real Host

#### (Screenshots for the day can be seen [here](../Screenshots/Day6.md). Judge away, oh mighty Judgers! )

## 🧱 Block 1: Environment Triage

### 🎯 Block Goal

Run targeted recon across each VM I have to determine where DVWA is actually installed and what service is exposing it.

#### Subtasks for Block 1

- [ ] 🔎 Check running services on Kali, Metasploitable2, and host machine
  - use `netstat`, `ss`, or `ps aux | grep apache` to find active web services
  - validate which systems have listeners on port `80` or `8080`
- [ ] 📂 File system sweep
  - look for `/var/www/html/dvwa` or `/config/config.inc.php`
  - use `find / -name "dvwa"` if needed (I've been told to prepare to scroll on this one)
- [ ] Hit each candidate IP in the browser
  - Test `localhost` and each VM's IP address
  - Confirm which one responds with DVWA's login page
- [ ] Verify Apache or other web server logs
  - try `sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log`
  - interact with DVWA and observe which machine responds

### 💻 Commands Used

```bash
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep :80
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep :8080
ps aux | grep apache
find / -name "config.inc.php" 2>/dev/null

```

### 📥 Outputs to look for

- IP + port pairing that *definitely* points to the DVWA host
- Apache or alternative HTTP service actively responding
- Location of `config.inc.php` or DVWA root directory
- Access logs showing actual requests hitting the system
