# 🛠️ Day #5 – Let’s Break More Stuff 💥💻

## 🎯 Overall Goal:

Master UNION-based SQL injection by dumping real data from the DVWA target, practicing controlled payload testing in Burp Suite, and documenting the full attack flow with clean, redacted screenshots.

#### (Screenshots for the day can be seen [here](../Screenshots/Day5.md). Judge away, oh mighty Judgers! )

## 🧱 Block 1: Advanced SQL Injection – Data Exfiltration

### 🎯 Block Goal:

Use `UNION SELECT` to enumerate tables, columns, and dump user credentials from DVWA’s database.

✅ Subtasks:

- [ ] Confirm working `UNION SELECT` with matching column count
- [ ] Enumerate table names from information_schema.tables
- [ ] Find interesting columns in the `users` table
- [ ] Dump usernames and password hashes
- [ ] Clean screenshots (Screenshots for the day can be seen [here](../Screenshots/Day5.md).):
  - [ ] Table discovery
  - [ ] Column discovery
  - [ ] Dumped credentials

### 💻 Commands Used:

```bash


```

### 🔧 Setup Notes:

- Burp suite is connected, and I learned about "Burp-Browser Flow". ![Burp to Browser OOP](/40DaysOfPentesting/Screenshots/raw-images/burp-flow.png 'Burp Order of Operations')
- DVWA is in `low` security mode
- Intercept is `off` for now, will toggle `on` when ready to modify requests
